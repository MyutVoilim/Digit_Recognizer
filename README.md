# AI Digit Recognizer
This is a passion project is meant to be the culmination of my skills in planning, design, and in general software development applied to subject i'm passionate about and is increasingly relavent, Artifical Intelligence. Adherings to OOP princables and applying concepting such as DRY and SOLID, This proejct is a Feed-Forwards Neural Network (FNN) that uses back propigation to train and improve at recognizing digits 0 - 9 built from the ground up. This project is highly interactive and allows for users to dynamically view the confidience values for digit that the user either activly draws or digits from the training data.

This is a passion project meant to demonstrate my software devlopment skills and apply my OOP skills to a complex and challenging

I am a problem solver and 

Some features that this program has are
- A canvas for the user to draw their own digits on
- Accuracy of the Neural Network
- Active visualization for how confident the Network is for any given number that the user is drawing or a digit from the training data
- The ability to create new strucutres for a personal network such as changing layer count and the repective node count for those layers, along with the ability to change the learning rate and epoch count
- The option to train/stop and test the accuracy of your neural network
