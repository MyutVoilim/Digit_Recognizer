![Digit Recognizer 2](https://github.com/MyutVoilim/Projects-Portfolio/assets/54462267/b6f11075-d122-4dbc-96d6-03a7fa03f8d2)

<b>Technologies:</b> C# | WPF | .Net Framework | Visual Studio

<b>Overview:</b> Utilizing the power of machine learning to recognize hand-drawn digits, this complex passion project is a from-scratch feed-forward neural network that implements backpropagation for error correction and it is the culmination of my journey as a developer and problem-solver. It not only showcases my proficiency in C#, OOP, and machine learning but also reflects my growth in planning, designing, and testing complex systems. Built with WPF in the .Net framework, this application offers an engaging and intuitive user experience.

<b>Features:</b>
- <b>Interactive Design:</b> allowing the user to draw or load digits with real-time confidence value feedback.
- <b>Customizable Neural Networks:</b> featuring the ability to create custom neural networks by defining hidden layer sizes and node counts.
- <b>Adjustable Training Parameters:</b> Control over training parameters such as learning rates and epoch counts to influence training route.
- <b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> Including dynamic visuals, progress bars, accuracy tracking, and confidence value displays.
- <b>Model Management:</b> Save, load, and swap out training data for greater flexibility and experimentation.
